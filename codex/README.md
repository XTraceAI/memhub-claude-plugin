# MemHub for OpenAI Codex

Codex isn't a Claude Code plugin, so the marketplace at the repo root doesn't
apply to it. Instead MemHub reaches Codex two ways, and neither needs a new
repo or a backend change:

1. **Memory tools inside Codex** — the MemHub MCP server is plain MCP, and
   Codex speaks MCP. Add one block to `~/.codex/config.toml` and
   `search_memory` / `save_artifact` / `import_conversation` are available in
   Codex.
2. **Session capture** — `import_codex_session.py` reads a Codex *rollout*
   transcript, reshapes it into the Claude Code record shape, and hands it to
   the plugin's `import_session.py`. That reshape is the whole trick: MemHub's
   agentic (tool-aware, gist-composing) ingestion auto-detects by *structure*,
   not by a platform tag, so a faithful transform gets the full extraction with
   no server change.

## 1. Memory tools in Codex (MCP)

Add to `~/.codex/config.toml` (prod shown; swap the URL for staging if you're a
MemHub developer):

```toml
[mcp_servers.memhub]
url = "https://api.memhub.xtrace.ai/mcp-server/mcp"
# staging: "https://api.staging.memhub.xtrace.ai/mcp-server/mcp"
```

Codex handles the OAuth browser flow on first use (same as its Notion server).
Verify with `codex mcp` / `codex doctor`.

## 2. Import a Codex session into team memory

```bash
# newest session:
uv run --with mcp python codex/import_codex_session.py --session latest

# a specific session (rollout path, or the bare session id), into a shared room:
uv run --with mcp python codex/import_codex_session.py \
    --session 019c6e48-b66c-7881-9301-99c87fc66cf6 \
    --agent-brain-id <room-id>
```

`--session` accepts a rollout path, a bare Codex session id (searched under
`~/.codex/sessions/`), or `latest`. The conversation id defaults to
`codex-<session-id>`, so re-imports are **incremental** — the server watermark
folds the session gist forward instead of duplicating.

Use `--dry-run` to see what would be sent (record count, tool calls, resolved
cwd/title) and write the transformed transcript without calling the server.
Auth is the same OAuth the MCP connector uses — no separate token to provision.

### What the transform does

Codex rollouts carry two parallel streams; capture reads the `response_item`
stream (the OpenAI Responses items actually exchanged with the model — the one
with tool I/O in order) and maps it 1:1 onto Claude Code records:

| Codex `response_item` | Claude Code record |
|---|---|
| `message` role=user | user text (Codex context injections — AGENTS.md, `<environment_context>`, IDE-setup wrappers — are stripped to the real ask) |
| `message` role=assistant | assistant text block |
| `reasoning` | assistant `thinking` block (summary only; `encrypted_content` dropped) |
| `function_call` / `custom_tool_call` | assistant `tool_use` block |
| `function_call_output` / `custom_tool_call_output` | user `tool_result` block |

Order is preserved (gpt-5.x emits `reasoning` before its `function_call`). A
leading provenance banner records the Codex origin, model, and cwd, since the
agentic path always tags the platform `claude`.

Run the tests: `python3 codex/test_codex_to_claude.py`.

## 3. Auto-capture (optional, verify on your Codex version)

Codex's `notify` config runs a program on session events. Point it at a wrapper
that imports the newest rollout when a session ends:

```toml
# ~/.codex/config.toml
notify = ["python3", "/absolute/path/to/codex/codex_notify.py"]
```

`codex_notify.py` is a thin filter: on a session-end event it runs
`import_codex_session.py --session latest`. Whether Codex emits a usable
session-end event varies by version — confirm with your build before relying on
it; the manual import above always works.
```
