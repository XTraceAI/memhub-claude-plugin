"""Codex `notify` handler — best-effort auto-capture of Codex sessions.

Wire it up in ``~/.codex/config.toml``::

    notify = ["python3", "/absolute/path/to/codex/codex_notify.py"]

Codex invokes the notify program with a single JSON argument describing an
event. On a turn/session-completion event this fires
``import_codex_session.py --session latest`` **detached** (fire-and-forget), so
Codex is never blocked. Re-importing is incremental (the server watermark folds
the session gist forward instead of duplicating), and a debounce caps auto-
imports to one per ``_MIN_INTERVAL_S`` seconds so a burst of turns doesn't
re-send the whole rollout each time.

This is deliberately conservative: unknown event shapes, parse failures, and
missing files all exit 0 silently. Auto-capture is a convenience; the manual
`import_codex_session.py` is always the reliable path.
