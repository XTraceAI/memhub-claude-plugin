description: Use when the user asks to save, store, or upload a file/document/spec to MemHub or team memory as an artifact (e.g. "save this spec to memhub", "store this doc as an artifact", "version this design doc in memhub"). Uploads the file's bytes via a terminal script — never call save_artifact directly or re-emit file contents.
argument-hint: <file-path> [artifact name]
allowed-tools: Bash

Store an existing file as a MemHub artifact. The file's bytes are uploaded by a
helper script — **do NOT call the `save_artifact` MCP tool yourself and do NOT
paste/retype the file contents**; that would regenerate the whole document token
by token. This is a terminal operation, like `cat`-ing a file.

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`
- First token = the path to the file to store (required). If invoked without a
  path (e.g. the user said "save this to memhub" about a file just discussed),
  use that file's path; ask if ambiguous.
- Remaining text = the artifact name (optional; if omitted, use the file's base
  name as a readable title).

Do exactly this:

1. Resolve the file path (`$1`) and a name. If no name was given, derive a short
   Title-Case name from the filename.
2. Pick an `artifact_type` from the extension/content: `spec`, `design_doc`,
   `adr`, `runbook`, or `document` (default).
3. Run the upload via Bash — substitute the real values, keep it one command:

   ```bash
   uv run --with mcp python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/save_artifact.py" \
     --file "<path>" --name "<name>" --type "<type>"
   ```

   Optional flags when relevant: `--agent-brain-id <id>` to save into an agent
   brain, `--parent-id <id>` to version an existing artifact, `--rationale "..."`
   to note why this version supersedes the last, `--tags a,b`.
4. Report the returned `{id, action}` to the user. On first ever run the script may
   open the browser once for OAuth approval (same flow as /mcp; token cached
   after that) — that is expected, not an error.

You only emit the short command with a path — the script reads the file and
ships it to `save_artifact`.
